# Folder Replicator

This contains a [Workspace Post-Create Event Handler](https://platform.relativity.com/9.7/Content/Building_Relativity_applications/Post_Workspace_Create_event_handlers.htm) that replicates the folder structure from the workspace template in [Relativity](https://www.relativity.com).

**Notes**

* Any folder-level security applied in the template workspace is _not_ replicated.
* If you're looking for a functional RAP for direct import into Relativity, use the RAP folder.  Install the RAP to the template workspace prior to new workspace creation.
